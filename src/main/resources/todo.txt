- add testing SceneManger, StageManager, Tile, MapObject,City,Civilization,TurnManager,Unit, GAmeManager

TODO:
- if the screen fit the curren scree, become full screen
- cleanup the code related to map
- refactor map manager so that only the render part in graphic, the rest is partitioned

caveat:
1. its working at the cost of upper scroll slower (since it havent reach 0.00)
2. sometime there is mini gap between coast, but after 3-4 reload of the program its disappear

TODO:
- if the screen fit the curren scree, become full screen
> bug kalau change ke resolution less than full screen, bottom lower not work for mouse
- flicker when full screen and change stage
- bug: change reoslution o fullscreen, dont update on setting
caveat:
1. its working at the cost of upper scroll slower (since it havent reach 0.00)
2. sometime there is mini gap between coast, but after 3-4 reload of the program its disappear
